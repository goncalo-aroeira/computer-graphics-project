**Computer Graphics Projects - IST 2022/23**

This repository contains the implementation of three computer graphics projects developed for the Computer Graphics course at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST). The projects focus on **scene modeling, interactive rendering, animation, and real-time visualization techniques** using **Three.js**.

## **Project Overview**
### **Project A: Scene Sketching & Technical Drawings**
- Understanding the importance of preliminary sketching before 3D modeling.
- Creating **hand-drawn scene compositions** and technical drawings.
- Designing **scene graphs** to define hierarchical transformations.
- Sketching **orthographic views** with dimensions and degrees of freedom.

### **Project B: Interactive Scene with Fixed Cameras & Animations**
- Implementing a **3D interactive scene** with **fixed cameras** and **geometry instancing**.
- Modeling a **transformable robot** in **Three.js** using basic geometric primitives.
- Developing **scene animations** with articulated transformations.
- Implementing **collision detection** for a trailer attachment system.
- Allowing the user to switch between **orthogonal and perspective projections**.

### **Project C: Textured & Lit Scene with Stereoscopic Camera**
- **Procedural texture generation** for landscapes and sky environments.
- **Heightmap-based terrain modeling** using **external tools**.
- Adding **realistic lighting** with directional and spotlight sources.
- Constructing a **low-poly Alentejo-inspired rural scene**.
- Implementing a **stereoscopic camera** for VR support.
- Creating an interactive **UFO animation** with spotlights and movement controls.

## **Installation & Setup**
To set up the projects:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-graphics-projects.git
   cd computer-graphics-projects
   ```

2. **Run a Local Development Server**
   If using **VS Code**, install the **Live Server** extension and open `index.html`.
   Alternatively, use Python’s built-in HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3. **Navigate Between Projects**
   - **Project A:** `/project-a`
   - **Project B:** `/project-b`
   - **Project C:** `/project-c`

## **Results Summary**
- **Project A:** Defined technical **sketches and scene graphs** for modeling.
- **Project B:** Developed a transformable **robot scene** with hierarchical animations.
- **Project C:** Created a **detailed textured scene** with **lighting and stereoscopic rendering**.

## **Challenges & Future Improvements**
- **Enhance animation realism** with physics-based motion.
- **Improve texture blending** for seamless environmental mapping.
- **Optimize rendering performance** for large-scale scenes.
